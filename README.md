# 🧠 Jabulente's Data Science & Agritech Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a passionate data analyst and agritech enthusiast with a strong background in crop production and management. My projects span statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization — many focused on solving real-world agricultural challenges.

Below you'll find a list of selected projects, each linked to its repository with a description of its purpose and methods.



##  1. [Analysis of Eggplant Resistance in Fusarium Wilt](https://github.com/Jabulente/Analysis-of-Eggplant-Resistance-in-Fusarium-Wilt)

**Description:**

This project presents a detailed statistical investigation into the resistance levels of different eggplant (*Solanum melongena*) varieties against *Fusarium wilt*, a major soil-borne fungal disease that severely limits crop productivity in many tropical and subtropical regions. Using real experimental data collected from controlled trials, the study aimed to determine which varieties demonstrated statistically significant resistance traits. The analysis began with exploratory data visualization to understand the distribution of resistance scores across varieties, followed by rigorous statistical testing. A one-way ANOVA was conducted to assess whether mean resistance levels varied significantly among the varieties, and a post-hoc Tukey HSD test was applied to pinpoint specific group differences. Results were interpreted not only statistically, but also agronomically, helping inform better varietal selection for future breeding and cultivation programs.

**🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used:**

* `Python` – primary programming language
* `pandas` – data manipulation and wrangling
* `seaborn` & `matplotlib` – data visualization
* `scipy.stats` – statistical testing (ANOVA)
* `statsmodels` – post-hoc Tukey HSD and model diagnostics
* `Jupyter Notebook` – interactive analysis and reporting


##  2. [Fertilizers’ Impact on Cowpea Growth and Yield](https://github.com/Jabulente/Cowpea-Fertilizer-Impact)

**📘 Project Overview:**
This project explores the influence of different fertilizer types on the growth performance and yield potential of cowpea (*Vigna unguiculata*), a vital legume crop in sub-Saharan Africa. Due to the absence of real experimental data, synthetic yet biologically plausible datasets were generated using controlled rules and domain-informed logic to mimic field-based agronomic trials. Fertilizer treatments included NPK, Urea, DAP, Organic, and a Control group. Variables simulated include plant height, number of pods per plant, biomass, seed weight, and final yield. The simulation was carefully designed to reflect realistic fertilizer responses in cowpea physiology. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to visualize trends across treatments. Statistical comparisons, including ANOVA and effect size calculations, were applied to evaluate the significance of fertilizer impacts. This project offers a compelling demonstration of how synthetic agronomic datasets can be used for modeling, insight generation, and training purposes — especially in regions where data scarcity limits research scalability.

**🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used:**

* `Python` – core programming language
* `numpy` & `random` – synthetic data generation
* `pandas` – dataset construction and transformation
* `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – comparative data visualization
* `scipy.stats` – ANOVA and statistical testing
* `statsmodels` – model summary and post-hoc analysis
* `Jupyter Notebook` – for presenting the full workflow
